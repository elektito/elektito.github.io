title: About
---

My name  is Mostafa  Razavi, and  I'm a  software developer  living in
Tehran, Iran. I use C++ and Python extensively in my day job and while
I mostly use Python for my side  projects, there is a special place in
my heart for Lisp!

I have extensive experience in writing network software: deep packet
inspection, network monitoring, packet capture and analysis and the
like. I am currently lead of a small team of developers creating a
high-traffic network appliance and I'm rather proud of the technical
aspect of the project.

This is my personal website. I mainly created this website so that I
have a place to point people to. I hope I'll use the blog to write
down the things I come across primarily for my own reference, and with
the hope that they will be useful to other people too.
